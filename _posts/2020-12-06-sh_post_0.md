Here's some basic test.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/Beatthezombie/beatthezombie.github.io)

Here's a bulleted list:
* first
* second
* third

1. first
2. second
3. third

Python code block:
```python
import numpy as np

def test_function(x,y):
z = np.sum(x,y)
return z
```

inline code  `x+y`  

$$ e^{i \pi} = -1 $$

inline math $$ e^{i \pi} = -1 $$
